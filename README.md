Bulkfollows.com - Automation Software. Using the Bulkfollows API, the software can place orders right from your desktop. For checking the order status, you need to add order ID and then click check status. On clicking check status, the text below would be updated. 

When a new order is placed, the bulkfollows api returns the Order ID. This ID is stored in a text file in the current working directory. If you want to check the status of the order, copy that order ID and put it in the Order ID field and click on check status. The `status:` label will be updated with the status. The order usually takes 3 days so you can check the order once in a day and see if the order has completed or not.

Add your data and let it place orders for you.
