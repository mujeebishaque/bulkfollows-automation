Bulkfollows.com - Automation Software. Using the Bulkfollows API, the software can place orders right from your desktop. For checking the order status, you need to add order ID and then click check status. On clicking check status, the text below would be updated. 

When a new order is placed, the bulkfollows api returns the Order ID. This ID is stored in a text file in the current working directory.

Add your data and let it place orders for you.
